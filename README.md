# Emotion Detection and Hate Speech Detection with Python NLP

## Overview
This project aims to implement emotion detection and hate speech detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. It involves the development of models capable of analyzing text data to classify emotions and identify hate speech.

## Features
- Emotion Detection:
  - Analyzes text data to classify the underlying emotion expressed.
  - Utilizes machine learning or deep learning models to predict emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
  - Provides insights into the emotional content of text for various applications including sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, etc.
  
- Hate Speech Detection:
  - Identifies hate speech and offensive language in text data.
  - Utilizes NLP techniques to classify text as hate speech or non-hate speech.
  - Can be used for content moderation in social media platforms, online forums, and other online communities.
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pysentimiento (A Python toolkit for Sentiment Analysis and Social NLP tasks)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-hatespeech-detection.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:
python main.py

## Dataset
- Emotion Detection: The dataset for emotion detection may include labeled text samples with corresponding emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, etc. Common datasets used for this task include the SemEval-2018 Task 1 dataset, ISEAR dataset, etc.
- Hate Speech Detection: The dataset for hate speech detection typically consists of labeled text samples with annotations indicating whether the text contains hate speech/offensive language or not. Common datasets for hate speech detection include the Hate Speech and Offensive Language dataset (HateSonar), Twitter Hate Speech Dataset, etc.

## Model Evaluation (pysentimiento lib provide)
- Emotion Detection: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to assess the performance of the emotion detection model.
- Hate Speech Detection: Evaluation metrics may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for binary classification tasks.
